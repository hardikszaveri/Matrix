We have provided you with a file containing a dictionary of words (dictionary.txt)
Using .NET, we would like you to write a program that will find all six-letter words that are built of two concatenated smaller words:

Examples:

how + let => howlet
iris + in => irisin
in + door => indoor

Write the program twice:
The first time, make the code as readable as possible.
The second time, make the program run as fast as possible.

Please provide any tests you have written to verify the functionality of your program.

You can ask questions or make assumptions on how the program should work. If you make assumptions, be sure to tell us what they are.
